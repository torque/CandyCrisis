## Candy Crisis

Candy Crisis is a [Puyo Puyo][puyo] clone, written by John Stiles quite
a while ago (information is a bit sparse, but it predates OS X). It was
the successor, or perhaps evolution, of his earlier Puyo Puyo clone,
called Skittles. Based on some Internet sluthery, it seems that Candy
Crisis was originally called Skittles 2, but the name was changed for what
I imagine should be fairly obvious copyright reasons.

The website Macintosh Garden has a tiny amount of information about both
[Skittles][MGSkittles] and [Candy Crisis][MGCandy Crisis], as well as a
few screenshots of them.

### So what is this?

The last official build of Candy Crisis was made for PPC macs, and it
ran fine until Apple got rid of Rosetta in 10.7, which made it
impossible for modern OS X to run old PPC executables.

Fortunately, Stiles released the source code for Candy Crisis on
SourceForge. The goal of this repository is to clean up the codebase a
little, and get it running on modern operating systems.

Yes, I am aware of [CCX][CCX]. However, I am mostly doing this as an
exercise for myself, to work on my C(++) fluency. There are also some
decisions CCX made that I disagree with.
